### Introduction

I like to sit in the woods, away from the hustle and
bustle of school, work, and society. It reminds me that 99% of the stress in
my life is artificial. Grades, money, relationships, all of it is just a human
game that we choose to play every day.

Nobody designed the woods. No one said, "this tree
looks best over here. Oh and this creek should run North-South to optimize
sunlight." And yet they're more beautiful than if someone had.

The woods came from the same place we all did, arising from nature,
changing by its happenings, and inevitably declining and returning to it.
Whenever I remember that, I know that my life follows the same course. All the
things causing me stress are like lightning strikes and forest fires
shaping the woods: painful, but also the agents of renewal and un-plannable
beauty.

While I love the woods, it can be a little hard to get far away from civilization
when I live in the heart of the Bay Area and don't have a car or multiple hours
to devote to travel, so normally I try to find a secluded, woodsy area on
campus to meditate in.

At a school of 35,000 students, though, there's bound to be situations where
unsuspecting people stumble across me while I meditate. Normally, when a group sees
me, their conversation cuts off and they walk a little faster until they're
past. Their feeling of awkwardness is tangible.

When I put myself in their shoes, I can see why: it's weird in 2018 to see
someone completely alone doing absolutely nothing. It arouses suspicion;
Why is he doing nothing? Is he mentally stable? Will he attack me if I get close?

### Modern Anxiety and Meditation

In the Age of the Internet, an era defined by its unrelenting connectedness
and limitless entertainment, where no one should ever be bored or lonely,
why would anyone ever choose to be unstimulated and alone? The funny thing is,
while we're more connected and stimulated than ever before, we're also plagued
by more boredom and loneliness than ever before.

Prolonged states of [anxiety](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/magazine/why-are-more-american-teenagers-than-ever-suffering-from-severe-anxiety.html)
and [depression](http://www.johnshopkinshealthreview.com/issues/fall-winter-2017/articles/the-rise-of-teen-depression)
in teens are increasing at alarming rates across the developed world, to levels higher
than ever before. As parents and professionals scramble to find the cause, many overlook
the fact that this increase went hand in hand with the takeover of the internet and social
media.

When we spend our time on the internet, refreshing feeds, watching netflix and
youtube, listening to podcasts, we're essentially **doing nothing**, but we're not:
we're being stimulated, we're receiving subconcious directives that we're
not as attractive or popular as so-and-so, that our lives *should* turn out like
the plot of a movie, that by buying the next best thing we will finally be
happy. **We're doing nothing, but we're always receiving external feedback**.

Meditation, then, is the perfection of doing nothing. By sitting in silence, free
from stimulation, we rid ourselves of external feedback. By being fully aware,
we cease to identify with the thoughts that inevitably arise, thus ridding ourselves
of internal feedback as well (as anyone who's been through middle school knows,
our "inner critic" can be the most scathing).

Free from all feedback, we regain the ability to see things as they really are.
Life is no longer a struggle against the bad hands it deals you, but rather it
is a symphony, where tensions and resolutions necessarily come and go to create
sublime harmony.

Take it from me; I've gone through extended bouts of depression for as long as
I can remember. In college, my depression and existential doubt got progressively worse,
and I felt like I had no idea who I was or why trying to be the way I thought
the world wanted me to be brought so much inner misery. I kept pushing on, thinking
there must be something I was missing, and, as it turns out, there was.

*Nothing.*

Until I tried meditating for real, where I actually disengaged from the
random thoughts that came up and concentrated on simply being, I never would've believed
that it has benefits beyond temporary relaxation and appearing woke. Now, however,
I see that underneath the trendiness, there's really something there, and that **it's
not coincidence people have practiced meditation for millenia.**

As far as I'm concerned, no arguments in favor of meditation will do it justice.
There's plenty of reasons to be skeptical, but until you've actually tried it,
don't write it off. The [data backs up](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/our-changing-culture/201511/why-adults-are-less-happy-they-used-be)
the common observation that as the world has become more consumerist, as we want
and receive more, we're becoming less happy. Rather than continuing to distract
ourselves from the sadness we feel, I think it's a worthy endevour to give nothingness
a try, and see for yourself what it can do.
