If you're on this page, you probably know my name is Connor. I'm a
rising senior EECS major at UC Berkeley, but I'm also a part-time software
engineer at [HERE Technologies](https://here.com), the forgettable bassist
of a band called [The Missionaries](https://the-missionaries.bandcamp.com),
a home-grown Minnesotan, risk manager of my fraternity, and president of
Cal's Buddhist Club.

I really enjoy a good story, so outside of classes for my major, I
like to study ancient history, language, mythology, and literature.

If any of this sounds interesting and you'd like to discuss it, feel free
to shoot me an e-mail using the link in the footer. I'll definitely reply,
and try my best to do so quickly.

### This Site

I plan to use this site for two purposes: one, as a standard portfolio
showcasing my projects and demonstrating (by existence) that I can make
a website, and two, as a personal blog to practice expressing my thoughts
coherently on a platform no one will really ever see, so that I don't
totally blow it if I ever need to.
