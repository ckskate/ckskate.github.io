If you're on this page, you probably know my name is Connor. I'm a
rising senior EECS major at UC Berkeley, but I'm also a part-time software
engineer at [HERE Technologies](https://here.com), the forgettable bassist
of a band called [The Missionaries](https://the-missionaries.bandcamp.com),
a home-grown Minnesotan, risk manager of my fraternity, and president of
Cal's Buddhist Club.

I really enjoy a good story, so outside of the requirements for my major, I
like to study history, foreign languages, mythology, and literature.
